# PHSX815_Project4
for Project 4 the measurements must be interpreted in the context of a real physics experiment or analysis. For example, categorical dice rolls could be interpreted as spin measurements, or a Gaussian likelihood could represent the uncertainty in a measurement. It is expected that students will include at least one contemporary citation providing background information about the experimental scenario.

## Project Description:  Orbit Stability Simulation of Planetary systems
In this project, we simulate artificial light curves of a sdB eclipsing binary system HS0705+6700 and determine the time of minimum of simulated primary eclipses by fitting a Gaussian profile. These pertain especially to observations using relatively small-aperture telescopes. We also evaluate the uncertainty in the time of  minimum determination of an eclipsing binary light curve constructed from a series of images with relatively long exposure times and image download times. Using this simulated data, we compare with the published time of minimum and evaluate the difference between true time of minimum and determined time of minimum. We also adjust different exposure time and explore how simulated time of minimum uncertainty would depart from default set up.

## For Peer reviewer [EXPIRED]
Since my previous projects already interpreted the simulation in the context of a real physics experiment, that is simulating a planetary system [only two planets] with orbital parameters samples from Beta distribution and evaluate stability outcomes from Bernoulli trails. Other natural sources of variation I could think of are number of planets orbiting, center mass of the planetary system, the other five planets' orbital elements, eccentricity, inclination, argument of pericentre, longitude of the ascending node, mean anomaly can be took into account for stability. I was wondering how to model these variations for the measurements, how do I measure these uncertainties statistically, and what are the questions I could address by this analysis.
